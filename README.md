# Civil Service Impact Index

The Civil Service LGBT Impact Index celebrates the civil servants making things better for LGBT people.

The Impact Index is a new initiative from the [Civil Service Rainbow Alliance](http://ukcsra.com) - the network representing LGBT civil servants - to recognise the important work that LGBT civil servants and allies do to improve the Civil Service and the public services that LGBT people rely on.

It builds on our work in recent years, highlighting the positive LGBT role models working in government.

The individuals, networks and teams featured in this Index are making things better for LGBT people: and we're proud to recognise them for their commitment to advancing LGBT equality both in the Civil Service and elsewhere.
