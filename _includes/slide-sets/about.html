				<p class="lead">We are proud to introduce the first ever Civil Service LGBT Impact Index</p>
					
				<p>The Civil Service LGBT Impact Index celebrates the civil servants making things better for LGBT people.</p>

				<p>The Impact Index is a new initiative from the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance - the network representing LGBT civil servants - to recognise the important work that LGBT civil servants and allies do to improve the Civil Service and the public services that LGBT people rely on.</p>
				
				<p>It builds on our work in recent years, highlighting the positive LGBT role models working in government.</p>
				
				<p>The individuals, networks and teams featured in this Index are making things better for LGBT people: and we're proud to recognise them for their commitment to advancing LGBT equality both in the Civil Service and elsewhere.</p>
				
				<p>You can see all the winners on this site, or you can <a href="{{ site.url | append: site.baseurl | append: '/assets/booklet-print.pdf' }}" title="Download a PDF of the Impact Index booklet">download a copy to print</a>. We have a limited number of hard copies of the guide too; if you'd like one, <a href="mailto:info@ukcsra.com" title="Contact CSRA via email">email us</a>.
